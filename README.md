Come here to see my Secret Santa Algorithm. I wrote this code in 30 minutes, so no judging. I mean you can, but then I'll judge you and nobody wants that.

The program requires a family.txt and prevMatches.txt to be in the same folder. Also filepaths are hardcoded because I was lazy. Update to whereve your repo is in code. You can find it. I believe in you.

family.txt syntax:
Each grouping aka rows with no spaces between them are "family" units which means they will not match with one another.

prevMatches.txt syntax:
Each row is a match from the year prior. Its the exact output of the program, so just copy and paste the year before.

If I felt like getting spicy I could add in multiple previous years, but that would require 5 more lines of code and 3 more minutes of work. No thank you
